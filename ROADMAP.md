## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Harper-Native First** - Leverage HarperDB's built-in capabilities
2. **Simplicity Over Features** - Only add what's needed
3. **Production-Ready** - Everything must be tested and reliable
4. **Multi-Backend Support** - Don't lock into one framework
5. **Developer Experience** - Clear docs, good errors, easy setup

### Technology Decisions

- **Why Harper?** - Built-in CRUD, clustering, file storage, worker jobs
- **Why Multi-Backend?** - Different models have different optimal runtimes
- **Why Profile-Based?** - Easy environment-specific configuration
- **Why CLI-First?** - Fastest path to value for developers

## Release Strategy

### Version Numbering

- **0.x.x** - Foundation and infrastructure (current)
- **1.x.x** - Milestone A complete (monitoring)
- **2.x.x** - Milestone C complete (training)
- **3.x.x** - Milestones B+D complete (full platform)

### Current Version: 0.9.0

**Next Release:** 1.0.0 (when Milestone A ships)

---

## Timeline (Aspirational)

```
2026 Q1: Complete Milestone A (Monitoring)
2026 Q2: Complete Milestone C (Training)
2026 Q3: Complete Milestone B (Feature Store)
2026 Q4: Complete Milestone D (Deployment Orchestration)
```

**Note:** Timeline subject to change based on contributor availability and priorities.

## Historical Context

### Why This Roadmap Exists

This roadmap was created to separate the project's **vision** (what we want to build) from its **reality** (what currently exists). The original README conflated these, making it hard for new users to understand what was actually implemented.

**For current capabilities**, see [README.md](README.md).

**For future plans**, you're in the right place.
